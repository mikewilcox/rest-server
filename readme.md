## Rest Server

This repo is for experiments using Node.js, Mongoose, Mongo, Express, and other packages such as
promise-io. This is not intended to be released as a project or open source, but you are welcome
to view or use any code as you see fit.

To run:

from rest-server, type:

This will launch an instance accessible by http://localhost:3000
